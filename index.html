        <section class="death">
            <h2>Death</h2>
            <p>Singh was martyred in 1968 near the Nathu La (pass) in eastern Sikkim, India.
                A board besides his shrine describes that he was martyred after falling into a nullah while
                escorting a mule column from Tuku La to Dongchui La.
            </p>
            <p>Harbhajan Singh's early death at the age of 22 is the subject of legend and religious veneration that has become popular among Indian Army regulars (jawans), 
                the people of his village and apparently soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) across the border guarding the Indo-Chinese 
                border between Sikkim and Tibet.</p>

        <section class="legacy">
            <h2>Legacy & Associated legend</h2>
            <p>He has come to be known as "Saint Baba".Every year on 11 September, a jeep departs with his personal 
                belongings to the nearest railway station, New Jalpaiguri, from where it is then sent by train to the
                village of Kuka, in the Kapurthala district of the Indian state of Punjab.</p>

            <p>
                While empty berths on any train of the Indian Railways are invariably allocated to any waitlisted passenger or on a 
                first-come-first-served basis by the coach attendants, a special reservation for the Baba is made. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Every year a seat is left empty for the journey to his hometown and three soldiers accompany the Baba to his home. A small sum of money
                 is contributed by soldiers posted in Nathula to be sent to his mother each month and his village still remembers him as martyr and undertook
                the initiative to help his family.
